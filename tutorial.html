    <h1 style="text-align: center;">How to download the GLibrary games!</h1>
    <p>This is a tutorial on how to download the GLibrary games so you can play
        them offline. You CANNOT use a phone or a tablet to download the games, 
        you need a computer.
    </p>
    <h2>Downloading the website</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/aysunwhatsup/aysunwhatsup.github.io">Go to the Aysun GitHub repository page.</a>
        It should look like this:
        <img src="github.png" width="500" alt="GitHub repository page">
        <br>
        Click on the green button that says "Code" and then click on "Download ZIP". This will
        download the entire website as a ZIP file (the website is only around 12MB currently, so it should be
        quick to download, and not take much space).
        </p>
        <h2>Running the GLibrary</h2>
        <p>Once you've extracted the ZIP file, click the file called
        "index.html". This will open the website in your default browser.
        You can also open the file "select.html" to go to the game selection page 
        directly, without using the hidden website button.
